**With these steps you provisioned the machine to install the necessary tools**

22) Open a terminal (powershell in windows) and go to the folder where you downloaded the PEM file in step 14 and run below command. Don't forget to replace **\<name of the pem file\>** with the name of your **keypair** file name and **\<PublicDNS\>** with **PublicDNS** value from previous step
	```bash
	ssh -i ./<name of the pem file>.pem ubuntu@<PublicDNS>
	```

**Note:**  If you receive an error saying **"Unprotected Private Key File"** run below commands and rerun the above command. 

For MacOS:

```bash
chmod 400 <name of the pem file>.pem
```

For Windows:

```bash
icacls .\<name of the pem file>.pem /inheritance:r
icacls .\<name of the pem file>.pem /grant:r "%username":"(R)"
```

23) Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/korzan-og/deaid-quickstart.git
```

24) Change directory to the folder and run below command to make the script runnable. 

```bash
cd deaid-quickstart
chmod +x install-dependencies.sh
```
Run below command to install the dependencies. The last command will install all dependencies with one script.
**It may take couple of minutes for script to complete**

```bash
./install-dependencies.sh
```

25) For some changes to take effect, disconnect from machine and reconnect by running the ssh command

```bash
exit
```

```bash
ssh -i ./<name of the pem file>.pem ubuntu@<PublicDNS>
```

26) Proceed to the first exercise! **Good luck**
